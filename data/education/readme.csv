This spreadsheet is an example of how we conventionally represent index data in a way which makes it easy to work with programatically
"It's for illustrative purposes only, the data itself is probably wrong in many places due to copy/paste errors etc."
It consists of 3 sheets with deliberately named columns

"The first two sheets define the structure of the index, the nature of the indicators that are taken into account and their weightings in calculating the final index"
index,"this is a list of all the factors that the index take into account, theay are typically give a three number identifier with the number separated bu ""."" e.g. ""1.1.4"" and ""3.2.2"" etc."
groups,"this is a list of the groupings into which the factors defined in ""index"" fall"

The third sheet contains the actual data
entities,"""entities"" can be countries, cities, schools, or any thing else. They are the subjects of the index"
